# web_Techopharm

My idea of this project is to create a series of wepagesb, where medicines can be bought online by the customers. 

The aim of this project to ensure the comfort and safety of the customers by providing 3-step quality assurance and having good record of essential details like manufacture date, expiry date, etc.

Separate pages are created for admin and users where each page contains different functionalities.

USE XAMPP Control panel.
RUN APACHE AND MYSQL.

# Check the code for webpages in the content folder!!
THE index page is cover.html

# Check the database i.e back-end in the DATABASE folder!!
